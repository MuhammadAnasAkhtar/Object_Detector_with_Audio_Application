# Object_Detector_with_Audio_Application
# Overview
The Object Detector with Audio Description application combines state-of-the-art object detection with natural language audio narration. It processes an input image, identifies objects in the image, and generates a narrated audio description of the detected objects. The detected objects are also highlighted with bounding boxes in the output image.

# Features
Object Detection: Identifies objects in an image using a pre-trained model (facebook/detr-resnet-50).
Bounding Box Visualization: Draws bounding boxes with labels and confidence scores on the image.
Audio Narration: Converts the detected objects into a natural language description and generates audio narration using the kakao-enterprise/vits-ljs model.
Interactive Web Interface: Powered by Gradio for easy-to-use functionality.
# How It Works
Upload an Image: Provide an image to the application.
Object Detection: The model detects objects and draws bounding boxes with labels and scores.
Generate Natural Text: A natural language description of the objects is created.
Audio Output: The text description is converted into an audio file and returned.
# Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed.

Steps to Run Locally
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/object-detector-audio.git
cd object-detector-audio
Install Dependencies: Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the Interface: Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:7860 to use the application.

Usage
Upload an Image:

Select an image from your local machine using the "Select Image" button.
View Results:

Processed Image: The image with bounding boxes and labels for detected objects.
Audio File: A .wav file containing the audio narration of the detected objects.
# Example
Input:
An image of a person with a dog.

Output:
Processed Image: Displays bounding boxes around the person and the dog with labels and confidence scores.
Audio: "This picture contains 1 person and 1 dog."
# Dependencies
Transformers: Provides pipelines for object-detection and text-to-speech.
Gradio: Interactive web-based interface.
Pillow: For image manipulation.
SciPy: For handling audio data.
Torch: Backend framework for inference.
Install all dependencies with:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Model Details
Object Detection Model: facebook/detr-resnet-50 from Hugging Face.
Text-to-Speech Model: kakao-enterprise/vits-ljs from Hugging Face.
Task: Detect objects in images, generate a natural language description, and convert the description into audio.
# Limitations
Performance depends on the clarity and quality of the input image.
Currently supports English text-to-speech output only.
Bounding box text font size and appearance may vary depending on the system's font support.
# Future Enhancements
Support for additional languages in audio narration.
Expand detection capabilities to include more object categories.
Add support for batch processing of multiple images.
